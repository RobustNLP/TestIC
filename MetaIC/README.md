## Environment requirements:
* Ubuntu 20.04.02 LTS
* Python 3.8
* Pytorch 1.7.1

## Structure of the code
The project includes code for our object inserting method, an implementation of MetaIC, data of the object source images we collect from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com), the result of our manual review for erroneous issues, and a tool to report prospective errors in MS COCO Caption.

## Related code and links we use in this project:
* Yolact++ (https://github.com/dbolya/yolact).
* Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/).
* Oscar and VinVL (https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar).
* Show, Attend and Tell (https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning).
* Code to generate the region feature for Oscar (https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention).
* Code to generate the region feature for VinVL (https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark).

## Object inserting method
The implementation of our object inserting method is in Insert_code, please refer to [Insert_Code\README.md](Insert_code\README.md) to get the information of how to use the code.

## Object source images
We collect a pool of object source images on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com), containing 60 categories (60 out of 80) of MS COCO Caption. Users can use Yolact++ to perform the segmentation on our collected [dataset](Object_Source_Images) and obtain high-quality standalone object images. Users can also download their own dataset on Flickr. 

## Report erroneous issues
This directory corresponds to the implementation of MetaIC to report suspicious issues of the 1 paid IC API and 5 IC models. Each directory contains:
* An implementation of MetaIC to check the MRs we propose in the paper.
* The captions produced by the IC we tested on the background image of the test dataset of MS COCO Caption, and our synthetic images with various overlapping ratios.
* The reported suspicious issues produced by MetaIC.
* Example(report suspicious issues for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Servicses with $ratio_0$):
  ```bash
    # Start to report the suspicious issues of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services:
    cd Report_erroneous_issues/azure_meta_relation_error_report_dir
    python meta_relation_error_report_0.py 
  ```
